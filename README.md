# challenge-1
First challenge

## description
In this first challenge of week 1, i am demonstrating my ability to 'clean up' and make both the CSS and HTML code more accessable to anyone that would like to view it
I have categorized the attributes in both HTML and CSS to make the code easy to read and more digestable
I have learnt that it is very easy to over complicate code and that is can lead to websites breaking or myself as the developer getting lost

Inside you will find an already pre-made code that i for a website that specializes in social media marketing called Horiseon.
